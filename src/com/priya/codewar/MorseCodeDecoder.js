/*
voice and digital data communication channels, it still has its use in some applications around the world.
The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes". For example, the letter A is coded as ·−,
letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital
letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes
and 3 spaces are used to separate words. For example, the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−−   ·−−− ··− −·· ·.

NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.

Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

For example:
MorseCodeDecoder.decode(".... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .")
//should return "HEY JUDE"

All the test strings would contain valid Morse code, so you may skip checking for errors and exceptions.
Good luck!
